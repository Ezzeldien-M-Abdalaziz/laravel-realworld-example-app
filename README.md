### Revision Feature Overview

The Article Revision system automatically stores previous versions of an article whenever itâ€™s updated.

Each revision stores the old title, description, body, and user ID.

Revisions are linked to their parent article.

#### Owners of articles can:

- List revisions of an article

- View a single revision

- Revert the article to a previous revision

### Assumptions & Design Decisions

- Only the article owner can access or revert revisions (enforced by ArticleRevisionPolicy)

- Revisions are created automatically by an Eloquent Observer (ArticleObserver).

- Unauthorized users get 403 Forbidden.

- Tests cover both happy path and unauthorized access.
### Testing

- Automated tests were added to ensure correctness:

- Unit Test

- ArticleObserverTest: verifies revisions are created on update.

- Feature Tests

#### ArticleRevisionTest: 
- covers listing, showing, reverting, and unauthorized access.

#### ArticleTest:
- ensures articles can be fetched correctly.

#### Run tests with:

- php artisan test


### Postman Collection

- A Postman collection is included in the project (postman/ArticleRevisions.postman_collection.json).

- Contains requests for list revisions, view revision, revert article.

- Preconfigured with auth tokens where required.
